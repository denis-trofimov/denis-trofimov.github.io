&lt;p&gt;Mob programming is the best approach for many development applications. Mob projects result in a more finished project at release, with fewer bugs. By focusing on one project at a time, teams can complete projects more efficiently, and those projects are higher quality, requiring fewer revisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello!
I got fresh new article from The Simple Programmer blog, Lessons Learned by Mentoring Programmers .
It is a good coincidence, for me it is the right time to get to know about mentoring.
I will take part the learn.python.ru course in Moscow as a new curator for a group of 5-6 students. I am totally new to all this field, teaching programming. I am to help students to get well with Python language, answer questions, check they homework, help to plan they project.</description>
