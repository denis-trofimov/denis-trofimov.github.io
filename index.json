Previously, parents can choose not only a name, but also an individual instruction to the child from Santa Claus.\n  “Hot lines” of Santa Claus have been working for more than a year, but, as a rule, they mean receiving incoming calls and playing out non-personalized greetings. For the first time in history, the new service will allow you to receive a personalized call from the main New Year wizard. Having picked up the phone, the child will hear his name 5 times, and if at the same time he needs to be more attentive to his studies or not to refuse vegetables at dinner, Grandfather will definitely say so in his congratulation. Parents choose a convenient date and time for the call on their own - the coveted call can be heard at least five minutes after the application has been left.\n  In addition, if the child has a brother or sister, congratulations will be addressed to both of them. A one-time congratulation is also provided for three children.\n  The project manager Maxim Shuvaev noted that over the last 7 days of December it is planned to make up to a million calls, but so far only in Russia.

It is an array whose indexes are obtained using a hash function on the keys. The goal of a hash function is to distribute the keys evenly in the array. A good hash function minimizes the number of collisions e.g. different keys having the same hash. Python does not have this kind of hash function. Its most important hash functions (for strings and ints) are very regular in common cases:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; map(hash, (0, 1, 2, 3)) [0, 1, 2, 3] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; map(hash, (\u0026#34;namea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nameb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;namec\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;named\u0026#34;)) [-1658398457, -1658398460, -1658398459, -1658398462] We are going to assume that we are using strings as keys for the rest of this post. The hash function for strings in Python is defined as:\narguments: string object returns: hash function string_hash: if hash cached: return it set len to string\u0026#39;s length initialize var p pointing to 1st char of string object set x to value pointed by p left shifted by 7 bits while len \u0026gt;= 0: set var x to (1000003 * x) xor value pointed by p increment pointer p set x to x xor length of string object cache x as the hash so we don\u0026#39;t need to calculate it again return x as the hash If you run hash(‘a’) in Python, it will execute string_hash() and return 12416037344. Here we assume we are using a 64-bit machine.\nIf an array of size x is used to store the key/value pairs then we use a mask equal to x-1 to calculate the slot index of the pair in the array. This makes the computation of the slot index fast. The probability to find an empty slot is high due to the resizing mechanism described below. This means that having a simple computation makes sense in most of the cases. If the size of the array is 8, the index for ‘a’ will be: hash(‘a’) \u0026amp; 7 = 0. The index for ‘b’ is 3, the index for ‘c’ is 2, the index for ‘z’ is 3 which is the same as ‘b’, here we have a collision.\nj = (5*j) + 1 + perturb; perturb \u0026gt;\u0026gt;= PERTURB_SHIFT; use j % 2**i as the next table index; typedef struct { Py_ssize_t me_hash; PyObject *me_key; PyObject *me_value; } PyDictEntry; typedef struct _dictobject PyDictObject; struct _dictobject { PyObject_HEAD Py_ssize_t ma_fill; Py_ssize_t ma_used; Py_ssize_t ma_mask; PyDictEntry *ma_table; PyDictEntry *(*ma_lookup)(PyDictObject *mp, PyObject *key, long hash); PyDictEntry ma_smalltable[PyDict_MINSIZE]; }; Dictionary initialization returns new dictionary object function PyDict_New: allocate new dictionary object clear dictionary\u0026#39;s table set dictionary\u0026#39;s number of used slots + dummy slots (ma_fill) to 0 set dictionary\u0026#39;s number of active slots (ma_used) to 0 set dictionary\u0026#39;s mask (ma_value) to dictionary size - 1 = 7 set dictionary\u0026#39;s lookup function to lookdict_string return allocated dictionary object arguments: dictionary, key, value returns: 0 if OK or -1 function PyDict_SetItem: if key\u0026#39;s hash cached: use hash else: calculate hash call insertdict with dictionary object, key, hash and value if key/value pair added successfully and capacity over 2/3: call dictresize to resize dictionary\u0026#39;s table ","date":1538161978,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538161978,"objectID":"d5fe5ae0f21fcd5cf5a2ef8eaf2a650b","permalink":"https://denis-trofimov.github.io/how-dictionaries-are-implemented-in-the-python-language/","publishdate":"2018-09-28T19:12:58Z","relpermalink":"/how-dictionaries-are-implemented-in-the-python-language/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["algorithms","code","data structures","interview","programming","python"],"title":"How dictionaries are implemented in the Python language","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["team lead"],"content":"Repost of https://simpleprogrammer.com/mob-programming/.Mob programming is the best approach for many development applications. Mob projects result in a more finished project at release, with fewer bugs. By focusing on one project at a time, teams can complete projects more efficiently, and those projects are higher quality, requiring fewer revisions.\nThe Project Management Institute’s 2017 Pulse of the Professionsurvey reports that 71 percent of organizations now use agile methodsto complete projects. Included among agile approaches is mob programming, defined by the Agile Allianceas “a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.” Picture multiple engineers at one station working collaboratively on one project.\nWhile many organizations have adopted mob programming as a core part of their development skill set, not all development organizations have bought in.\nStill, to implement mob programming successfully, you need buy-in from two important groups at your organization—the executive team and the programmers themselves.\nBy following the strategies below, you can get organization buy-in for mob programming from top to bottom and start using this agile development methodology to provide superior finished products for clients both inside and outside your organization.\nGetting Buy-in From Leadership As far back as 2000, the benefits of developers teaming up on projects to solve problems have been evaluated against the performance of individuals. An oft-cited joint studybetween the University of North Carolina and the University of Utah showed that paired programmers were 15 percent more successful in solving problems and that their solutions did so with fewer lines of code.\nThat may not be an impressive enough statistic for senior leadership, however. Shouldn’t it be at least 100 percent more efficient in order to be cost-effective?\nThe truth of the matter is that such small efficiency gains in the short run may not be convincing. It’s a long game, and you’ll need to open leadership’s eyes to the possibilities of multiple projects spanning months, even years.\nIf you can get leadership to agree to a six- to 12-month trial for mob programming, here are some of the benefits your organization will see:\n Fully inventoried projects: With groups working more thoroughly and quickly on fewer projects, projects are less likely to be abandoned or forgotten, and more projects are fully completed. More eyes on every project means projects are more complete when they are released to the world. Shorter turnaround on projects: Projects are completed quicker than when worked on by individual developers. With more eyes on each project, roadblocks are more easily overcome, and solutions to problems can quickly be brainstormed. Fewer issues in live projects: As the projects are fully inventoried with more people reviewing every line of code, fewer bugs make it to the production environment. With individual developers working on projects, it’s often understood that there will be bugs that need to be fixed while a platform is live. You can eliminate a lot of this necessary rework through mob programming. Quicker onboarding for programmers: Onboarding into a mob programming environment is more efficient, as you can drop new developers right into a mob that’s already at work on a project and get them contributing immediately rather than having to divert resources for training and management of new programmers’ early projects with your organization.  Over time, mob programming improves efficiency not only in the completion of successful projects but also in the integration of new team members. You may not see the return on investment right away, but over time, it will be evident.\nBetter results, faster, with fewer abandoned projects—that’s something any senior leader can get behind.\nGetting Buy-in From Programmers, Developers, and Engineers Many engineers, developers, and programmers are used to working alone—putting on the headphones and sitting down to crank out code, cut off from the outside world, for hours at a time. How do you get people who are used to working alone to be active participants in a group environment where the major reason for increased success is teamwork?\nIn our experience, having gone through many iterations of mob programming while integrating it into the organization at Clearlink, not everyone is a good fit for mob programming—but many more than you would expect actually are, once they are involved.\nWhy is that? Believe it or not, engineers like socializing with their colleagues, they just haven’t always had the chance to do so. Once they realize the level of engagement and the quality of code that is created while working collaboratively, job satisfaction increases, learning increases, and enhanced team bonding occurs. Mob programming is also a meritocracy where the best idea wins, and everyone in the mob has an equal voice—from the most senior developer on the team down to the newest arrival.\nEach mob contains two roles: the driver and the navigator(s). The driver sits at the computer, inputting the code, while the navigators tell the driver what to type. These roles switch in the mob at regular eight to 15-minute intervals, giving everyone an equal chance to drive and to navigate.\nEveryone remains actively involved in the process, with ideas being shared and implemented quickly. Since everyone gets a chance to navigate, junior programmers gain confidence by asserting their ideas.\nWe recommend, either at the completion of a project or at the end of each workweek, recognizing mob team members for their contributions to the project(s) they have worked on. Also, allow programmers to share what they learned and what they had trouble with. After a few projects and a few of these recognition and retrospective meetings, your team members will be comfortable working together and fully integrated into the mob programming mindset.\nMaking the Jump Changing development work from an individual to a mob programming style can be a big leap—one that can result in a few stumbles along the way. But once you get buy-in from leadership for a trial and can get some programmers on board, you’ll see how it can benefit your organization.\nWe’ve given you some navigation—so get ready to drive.\n  Photo by Georgia National GuardCC 2.0 ","date":1536963470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536963470,"objectID":"ff2998bb2b6419749b7567cc7abcb13d","permalink":"https://denis-trofimov.github.io/getting-mob-programming-buy-in-at-your-organization/","publishdate":"2018-09-14T22:17:50Z","relpermalink":"/getting-mob-programming-buy-in-at-your-organization/","section":"post","summary":"Repost of https://simpleprogrammer.com/mob-programming/.Mob programming is the best approach for many development applications.

His source code, written in Matlab, has been the baseline for generations of iris recognition coders. Recently there are a number of new open source codes come up. They are more mature and meet state-of-the-art accuracy.
