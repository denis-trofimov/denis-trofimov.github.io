* I am a Go/Python/C++/C software engineer and working in software development since 2010.
* For the last 3 years I did Platform Engineering, the development of the Internal Developer Portal (IDP), and making organizations shift left on the DevOps paradigm.
* In the past I've designed and developed standalone and client-server applications, with databases like Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
* Created applications serving CRM, web automated order processing, and simulation of the technological operation of railroad rolling stock.
