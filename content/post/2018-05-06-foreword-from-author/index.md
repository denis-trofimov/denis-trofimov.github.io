First of all I would like to thank one person for reasoning me to start a developer blog. This person is John Sonmez, the author of the email course on creating a blog that boosts your career [&#8220;How to Create a Blog That BOOSTS Your Career&#8221;][1] and the founder of the [Simple Programmer.][2]

In this blog I plan to teach my reader step by step how to tackle tasks of the machine learnig in the computer vision using Python tools. I would like to show how a reader can start using former buzzwords like machine learnig, neural networks, computer vision, as a corresponding tools, Caffe package, TensorFlow, OpenCV. I know it is challeging to describe a complex notions ia a simple words, but I will try my best.

Q:  Why do I belive that my expertise can be valuable?  
A:  In the company I am working since 2017 our team is solving problems like a face image segmentation, an eye image segmentation, an eye iris feature detection and encoding.
