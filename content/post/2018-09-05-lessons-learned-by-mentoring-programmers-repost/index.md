Hello!

I got fresh new article from The Simple Programmer blog, [Lessons Learned by Mentoring Programmers][1] .

It is a good coincidence, for me it is the right time to get to know about mentoring.

I will take part the [learn.python.ru][2] course in Moscow as a new curator for a group of 5-6 students. I am totally new to all this field, teaching programming. I am to help students to get well with Python language, answer questions, check they homework, help to plan they project. That course will be 10 weeks long.

I urge you to read Ryan\`s post. It covers the topics:

  1. > Get well with mentor imposter syndrome.

  2. > Encourage your mentee work because they need it.

  3. > If the concept is good not nitpick the form.

  4. > Your Way Isn’t Always the Only Way.

  5. > You Are Not Wasting Their Time.

  6. > Use Questions to Collaborate

Thanks to author [Ryan Palo][3]! Please keep on writing and sharing!
