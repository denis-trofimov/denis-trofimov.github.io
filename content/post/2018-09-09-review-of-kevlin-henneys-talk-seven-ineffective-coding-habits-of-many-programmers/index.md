## Kevlin Henney\`s talk video description

> Habits help you manage the code complexity. You apply existing skill and knowledge automatically to the detail while focusing on the bigger picture.
>
> But because you acquire habits largely by imitation, and rarely question them, how do you know your habits are effective?

[Kevlin Henney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlin_Henney) [@kevlinhenney](https://twitter.com/kevlinhenney) examines seven coding habits that are not as effective as programmers believe, and to suggest alternatives.
