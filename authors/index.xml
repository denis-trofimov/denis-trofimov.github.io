      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am C++/C/Python developer with the employment history of 9 years in a software development.
I am making my living developing applications, working for the company Vsor Systems LLC in Moscow, Russia.
I am leading our small developing department that consists of 3 developers.
I am working on the software project for the our company&amp;rsquo;s product, an eye iris identification system. This software uses machine learning convolutional neural networks for camera image analysis (computer vision) and runs on a GPU or CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my past I have designed and developed standalone and client - server applications  C++/Python, with databases like Oracle DB, PosgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.
Created applications serving CRM, web automated order processing, simulation of technological operation of railroad rolling stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am near 40. I have spent quite a time in the software industry, not as long as &amp;ldquo;Uncle&amp;rdquo; Bob Martin of cause, but have also seen some technologies come and go. Words like this was in favor once: Delphi, Java, HTML, JavaScript, PHP&amp;hellip; Plus my beard is making me look like wise one ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;
